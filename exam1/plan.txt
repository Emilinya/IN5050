  - sad_block_8x8 takes up ~80 % of computing time, it is the top priority
    * a sum of absolute differencec of two 8x8 blocks.
      > 8x8 uin8 can fit in one uint8x16x4_t vector
      > absolute difference intrinsic: vabdq_u8
      > problem: there is no vabdq_u8_x4 intinsic, or similar for add
      > sum: split vector in two and add parts together
  - me_block_8x8 takes up ~13 % of computing time
