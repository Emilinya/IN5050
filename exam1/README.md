# Testing
Fast codec can be compared to reference codec by running `make test`. This defaults to 10 frames, but that can be changed with the `COMP_FRAMES` variable.
Comparison requires reference codec, which can be downloaded at https://bitbucket.org/mpg_code/in5050-codec63/src. Comparison also uses the image `foreman.yuv`,
which can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/mpg_code/in5050-mjpeg.
